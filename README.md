## üõ°Ô∏è Microsoft Sentinel Integration

### Setup Microsoft Sentinel Integration

1. **Get Microsoft Sentinel credentials**:
   - Navigate to your Log Analytics workspace in Azure Portal
   - Go to "Agents management" > "Log Analytics agent"
   - Note your Workspace ID and Primary Key

2. **Configure SOCca for Sentinel**:
   - Add these settings to your `.env` file:
   ```
   SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_ID=your-sentinel-workspace-id
   SENTINEL_PRIMARY_KEY=your-sentinel-primary-key
   SENTINEL_LOG_TYPE=SOCcaCVE    # Custom log type name
   SENTINEL_API_VERSION=2016-04-01
   ```

3. **Start the integration**:
   ```bash
   # Send vulnerability data to Sentinel
   python3 kryptos_working/sentinel_exporter.py --direct-send
   
   # Generate alert templates for Sentinel
   python3 kryptos_working/sentinel_exporter.py --alerts
   ```

### Using Vulnerability Data in Microsoft Sentinel

#### 1. Query the Data

Once data is in Sentinel, you can query it using KQL:

```kusto
// View all vulnerabilities
SOCcaCVE_CL
| limit 100

// High severity vulnerabilities in the last 24 hours
SOCcaCVE_CL
| where Severity_s == "Critical" or Severity_s == "High"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| project CVE_ID_s, Description_s, CVSS_Score_d, AffectedProducts_s, MitreAttackTactics_s
```

#### 2. Create Workbooks

Create a custom workbook in Microsoft Sentinel:

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Sentinel** > **Workbooks** > **New**
2. Add a new query with this KQL:

```kusto
// CVE severity distribution over time
SOCcaCVE_CL
| summarize count() by Severity_s, bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| render columnchart
```

#### 3. Set Up Analytics Rules

Import the generated alert templates or create custom rules:

1. Go to **Microsoft Sentinel** > **Analytics** > **Create** > **Scheduled query rule**
2. Configure a rule using KQL like:

```kusto
SOCcaCVE_CL
| where CVSS_Score_d >= 8.0
| where AffectedProducts_s has_any("Windows Server", "Azure", "Office 365")
```

## üöÄ Docker Deployment Options

SOCca is designed to run in Docker containers with multiple deployment options to fit different needs:

### All-in-One Deployment (Recommended)

The simplest way to run SOCca with everything in a single container:

```bash
# Start SOCca with the helper script
./docker-compose.sh start
```

This runs the CVE monitor and Sentinel exporter in the same container, suitable for most use cases.

### Microservices Deployment

For more granular control, run the components in separate containers:

```bash
# Start SOCca as microservices
./docker-compose.sh micro
```

This runs:
- `socca-monitor` - Polls the NVD API and processes CVEs
- `socca-sentinel` - Exports data to Microsoft Sentinel on a schedule

### Production Deployment

For production environments with resource controls:

```bash
# Start SOCca in production mode
./docker-compose.sh prod
```

Features:
- CPU and memory limits
- Log rotation
- Separate production environment file
- Optimized for 24/7 operation

### Configuration & Management

The helper script provides comprehensive management:

```bash
# Show all available commands
./docker-compose.sh help

# Common operations
./docker-compose.sh logs     # View container logs
./docker-compose.sh status   # Check container status
./docker-compose.sh restart  # Restart containers
./docker-compose.sh backup   # Create a full backup
./docker-compose.sh restore  # Restore from backup
```

### Data Persistence

All data is stored in Docker volumes:
- `socca-data` - Databases and cached content
- `socca-logs` - Application logs
- `socca-kryptos-logs` - Component-specific logs

### Advanced Docker Configuration

For advanced users, edit docker-compose.yml directly:
- Add custom resource limits
- Configure networking options
- Set up additional volumes
- Add container labels

For detailed configuration options, refer to comments in the docker-compose.yml file.

## üìä Advanced Configuration

### Customizing AI Analysis

To modify how vulnerabilities are analyzed:

1. Edit the system prompts in `soccav5.py` 
2. Adjust the token handling for larger or more detailed reports
3. Update the reporting structure to include additional fields

### Scheduling and Automation

The system has been optimized to ensure true real-time CVE processing with Microsoft Sentinel:

1. **Immediate CVE Processing**: Each CVE is sent to Microsoft Sentinel in real-time immediately after processing
2. **Verification**: Each send operation is verified to ensure data is properly tracked in the database
3. **Performance Metrics**: Processing time for each CVE is measured and logged
4. **Automatic Retry**: Failed sends are automatically retried with exponential backoff
5. **Alert Templates**: Alert templates are generated every 2 hours

For custom scheduling, you can use the microservices deployment mode:

```bash
# Start with dedicated Sentinel export service
./docker-compose.sh micro
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Docker Deployment Issues

1. **Container doesn't start**:
   ```bash
   # Check container logs
   ./docker-compose.sh logs
   
   # Check container status
   ./docker-compose.sh status
   
   # Verify your .env file has required variables
   cat .env | grep -E 'API_KEY|WORKSPACE_ID'
   ```

2. **Database initialization errors**:
   ```bash
   # Force rebuild of the image
   ./docker-compose.sh build
   
   # Reset the container and volumes
   ./docker-compose.sh reset
   ./docker-compose.sh start
   ```

3. **Permission issues with volumes**:
   ```bash
   # Fix permissions in container
   docker exec -it socca bash -c "chmod -R 755 /app/kryptos_working/data"
   ```

4. **Container health checks failing**:
   ```bash
   # Check container health
   docker inspect --format "{{.State.Health.Status}}" socca
   
   # View container health logs
   docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health}}" socca | jq
   ```

### Microsoft Sentinel Integration Issues

1. **Missing data in Sentinel**:
   - Verify SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_ID and SENTINEL_PRIMARY_KEY are correct
   - Check logs with `./docker-compose.sh logs`
   - Ensure outbound HTTPS connections are allowed

2. **API rate limiting**:
   - Adjust POLLING_INTERVAL in .env file to reduce API calls
   - Check NVD API logs for rate limit errors

3. **OpenAI API issues**:
   - Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is correctly set
   - Confirm that the specified models are available for your account
   - Check OpenAI response in logs

4. **Container networking issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check if container can reach external services
   docker exec -it socca curl -I https://services.nvd.nist.gov
   ```

For more detailed troubleshooting, see the logs:
```bash
./docker-compose.sh logs
```
