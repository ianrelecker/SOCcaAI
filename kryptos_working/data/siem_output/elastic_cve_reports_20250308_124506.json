The Mail Disguise module is designed to obfuscate email addresses on websites to prevent spambots from gathering them. However, the module contains a flaw in how it validates the `data` attribute value within `<a>` HTML elements that it generates. If exploited, this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's session, potentially leading to various adverse effects.\n\n**Affected Systems**:\n- Backdrop CMS versions before 1.x-1.0.5.\n\n**Underlying Causes**:\n- Insufficient data validation on user-generated content related to the mail disguise functionality.\n\n### Risk and Severity Analysis\nUsing the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1, this vulnerability is scored as follows:\n- **Base Score**: 6.4\n- **Base Severity**: Medium\n\n#### Rationale:\n- **Attack Vector (Network)**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network without physical access to the system.\n- **Attack Complexity (Low)**: The exploitation does not require sophisticated techniques, making it accessible to both novice and experienced attackers.\n- **Privileges Required (Low)**: Only a low level of privileges is needed to exploit the vulnerability, which could be easily achievable.\n- **User Interaction (None)**: Victims do not need to perform any specific action for the attack to be successful.\n- **Scope (Changed)**: Successful exploitation could affect the application in ways that lead to unauthorized data access or modification, impacting users\u2019 sessions and potentially their accounts.\n- **Confidentiality Impact (Low)**: Exploitation may allow unauthorized access to some user data.\n- **Integrity Impact (Low)**: An attacker could manipulate the client's browser by executing scripts, thus impacting the integrity of the session.\n- **Availability Impact (None)**: The vulnerability does not affect the availability of the application.\n\n**Potential Business and Operational Impacts**:\n- If attackers leverage this vulnerability, they could deploy phishing attacks or control users\u2019 sessions, causing reputational damage, loss of user trust, and potential data breaches.\n\n### Attack Surface and Exploitability\nExploitation of CVE-2025-27823 requires the following prerequisites:\n- The ability to insert `<a>` HTML elements with malicious `data` attributes directly into the web page, which could be achieved through user input mechanisms, such as comments or messaging features of the CMS.\n- Attackers could achieve arbitrary script execution, which could lead to session hijacking or even the exfiltration of sensitive data from users' browsers while they are logged into the site.\n\n### Alignment with Security Frameworks\nThis vulnerability can be mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework with the following Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):\n- **Tactic**: Execution (TA0002)\n  - **Technique**: User Execution (T1203) \u2013 The attacker may rely on enticing victims to execute the malicious payload inadvertently.\n  \nMapping attacks to this framework enables security teams to refine their detection capabilities and enhance their incident response strategies. It supports proactive security measures by identifying potential exploitation methods and user behaviors that can be monitored.\n\n### Detection and Validation\nTo test for the vulnerability, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Input Points**: Check for areas in your application where users can input data to create `<a>` elements, such as comments sections or message fields.\n   \n2. **Penetration Testing**:\n   Use the following basic payload to test the vulnerability via JavaScript injection:\n   ```html\n   <a href=\"#\" data-attr=\"onclick='alert(1)'\">Test XSS</a>\n   ```\n   - Place this payload in any input area to see if it executes the JavaScript.\n\n3. **Recommended Tools**:\n   - **OWASP ZAP**: for scanning and testing web applications for XSS vulnerabilities.\n   - **Burp Suite**: to analyze and intercept requests, allowing insertion of payloads.\n   - **Nessus**: to scan for known vulnerabilities in web applications.\n  \n4. **Automated Scanning**: Use the Nmap script for XSS detection.\n   ```bash\n   nmap --script http-xss --script-args \"http-xss.url=/path/to/vulnerable/resource\" your-target-ip\n   ```\n\n### Mitigation and Remediation Recommendations\n#### Immediate Mitigation Steps:\n1. **Update the Module**: Upgrade to the latest version of the Mail Disguise module (1.x-1.0.5 or later) to eliminate the vulnerability.\n2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a robust Content Security Policy to mitigate the risks of XSS by controlling the sources of content that can be loaded.\n3. **Input Validation**: Enhance server-side validation for user inputs to prevent any potential script injections.\n\n#### Long-term Remediation Advice:\n- **Regular Code Audits**: Conduct routine security assessments and code reviews to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.\n- **Training**: Ensure developers are trained in secure coding practices, particularly regarding input validation and output encoding strategies as outlined by the OWASP top 10 guidelines.\n  \nIf a full fix is unavailable:\n- Employ web application firewalls (WAF) to help mitigate the risk of exploitation while waiting for a patch.\n\n### Secure Code Review\nIf you conduct any code review processes, ensure to focus on:\n- Robust input validation to prevent the insertion of potentially harmful scripts.\n- Use of libraries or frameworks that automatically handle output encoding.\n- Detailed sanitization before displaying user-uploaded content.\n\n### Further Resources\n- [CVE-2025-27823 Advisory](https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-contrib-2025-007)\n- [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-prevention-cheat-sheet)\n- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org)\n- Backdrop CMS Security Updates Subscription Instructions: [Join the Security Mailing List](https://backdropcms.org)\n\nBy diligently following the recommendations in this report, organizations can effectively defend against the exploitation of CVE-2025-27823, prioritizing both immediate response and long-term strategic planning to safeguard their applications and user data.\n\nSocca Version 5.0"}, "metadata": {"description": "An issue was discovered in the Mail Disguise module before 1.x-1.0.5 for Backdrop CMS.
